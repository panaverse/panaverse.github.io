The internet is without a doubt the most important technological development in human history. Web3 and metaverse technologies expand the internet as we know it by introducing novel features and advancements. Metaverse will make use of all aspects of modern technology, including 3D, VR, AR, AI, blockchain, cloud computing, voice computing, ambient computing, and more.

Citi is the latest Wall Street business to give a positive prognosis for Web 3.0 and the Metaverse, terms used to depict a future internet vision centred on decentralised technologies and virtual worlds. Citi stated in a March 2022 [research paper](https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/metaverse-and-money/) that the metaverse economy might have a total addressable market of up to $13 trillion and five billion people by 2030.

## The Program in a Nutshell: Earn While You Learn

In this brand-new type of curriculum, students will learn how to make money and boost exports in the classroom and will begin doing so within six months of the program's beginning. It resembles a cross between a corporate venture and an educational project.

## Program of Studies

This curriculum is intended for beginners who want to learn software development from the ground up. The first two quarters are shared by all specialities and are dedicated to studying Object-Oriented Programming and cutting-edge Full-Stack Web 2.0 development. It is going to be a year-long hybrid programme that includes both onsite and online classes and is divided into four quarters of 13 weeks each. The emphasis will be on hands-on learning by educating students to produce projects. To accommodate everyone, courses will be held primarily on weekends or after 6:00 p.m. (Pakistan Time) on weekdays. It employs a hybrid teaching format, with core onsite classes complemented by online Zoom laboratories and recorded videos.

Note: For AWS Free Tier you will need a credit or debit card. The easiest way for Pakistani students is to open a bank account with Meezan Bank. Open a Meezan Aasan Account if you have no earning proof. Meezan Bank will charge Rs. 1100 for ATM Debit Card and there is a requirement of Rs. 100 minimum deposit. The card will be delivered in a few weeks. Our students have reported that this Debit card works with AWS.

Now you can create a virtual VISA Debit card through the NayaPay app (https://www.nayapay.com/ ) which can be used to create AWS/GCP/Azure accounts. This is good news for those students who find it difficult to create physical debit and credit cards from banks.

You can also get a $300 credit

Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token

By creating a token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralized service in the future.

Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).

Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use OpenZeppelin contracts. You will use the Hardhat development environment. Also, write at least twenty automated tests. We will be using Solidity and Typescript for development.

Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract

This contract will be responsible for allowing users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)

Implement a payable buyToken() function. 

Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought

Transfer 75% of the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal "owner" account.

Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.

You can use the openzeppelin crowd sale contracts [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales) however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.

Also write extensive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract's balance should have been reduced.

Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review access control
[https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control) 

Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask

While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!

We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.

When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts were uploaded to and copy it!

Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.

After the transaction has been confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to "register" it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!

To do this, open the side menu and click on the "Add token" button to get started:

Once you're on the token page, click on "Add custom token" and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.

After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

Project Part 6: Trying it with Multisignature Wallets

Read [https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/) 

[Now use Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) with multi-sigs to do what you did in the last part.


Project Part 7: Sending Tokens using Ethers.js 

Write a Typescript program to send Pako Token to some friend's address using Ethers.js.

The Web is the Metaverse. The metaverse requires an infrastructure that connects all of the metaverses so that we can travel between them. This is only achievable with open web-based metaverses. The internet and its browsers are magical. Federated but linked experiences connect pages, people, technology, businesses, standards, and nations. It's unlike anything else. The metaverse should replicate the best qualities of the web - it should just be the web. We just have to extend online responsive design from mobile to desktop to 3D, Augmented Reality, and Virtual Reality. This course will teach you how to build the Open Social Spatial Web with WebXR and WebGPU technologies.
